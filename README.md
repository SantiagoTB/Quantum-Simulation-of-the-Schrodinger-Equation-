# Quantum-Simulation-of-the-Schrodinger-Equation-
he essence of performing a quantum simulation is to be able to predict the final state of a quantum system given its initial state. In this project, a quantum simulation using Qiskit has been developed to describe the dynamics of a quantum state influenced by the step potential
